## release ChangeLog

### (NextVersion)
 * Added support for Open Type (`Ctrl+Shift+T`)
 * Fixed: Build Target's append environment variables might not replace variables correctly in Windows, due to case issues.

### 0.8.0
 * Added support for Cargo's JSON output, with `--message-format=json`. (#138) 
 * Invoking a build operation for a project now immediately cancels the pending build operation for that project, if any.
   * (this greatly improves user experience)
 * Added syntax coloring support for `?` operator, and `macro_rules!`.
 * More lenient with `rustfmt` exit code 3, don't treat those warnings as a failure. (#144)
 * Build target `check` now defaults to `cargo check --message-format=json`.
   * Note: As of the time of this release, `cargo check` only available in nightly Rust. 
 * Added: Cargo `clean` Build Target. 
 * Fixed: "Member `def_site_span` is not an Object" error. (#146)
 * Fixed: Creating an Eclipse project (with "Use `cargo init`" disabled) in a location with an existing crate no longer creates a Hello World `src/main.rs`.

### 0.7.0
 * Added support for Rust 1.12 new error message format. (#130)
  * Please upgrade to Rust 1.12 or later because the previous Rust toolchain versions are no longer supported in RustDT. 
  * (Thanks to https://github.com/PieterPenninckx for the contribution)
  * Note: be aware of [this Cargo issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/37011) which might sometimes prevent errors to be parsed by RustDT. This will be addressed in a future RustDT release (see https://github.com/RustDT/RustDT/issues/138)
 * Improved syntax highlighting for macro invocations (`foo!=bar` no longer highlights `foo!` as a macro) 
 * Added more extensive `doc` code snippet.
 * Added `matchRes` and `matchOpt` code snippets.
 * Default setting for "auto-insert" of Code Snippets is now false.
 * Added `--force` to Cargo tool "Download" button in toolchain preferences page.
 * Fixed: finding Build Target executables for crates that have a dash ('-') in the name. (the dash is converted to an underscore).
 * Fixed stale validation message for location field in New Project Wizard.
 * Fixed stale validation message for Build Command field in Build Targets property page and Launch Configurations dialog.
 * Fixed editor NPE when opening files from a non-workspace VCS revision.
 * Fixed: "IllegalStateException: Invalid table definition" during Cargo manifest parsing. (#129) 

### 0.6.2
 * Updated minimum CDT to version `9.0` (Eclipse Neon).
 * Added: validation of crate name for Rust Project Wizard. (#119)
 * Removed preference "Show error dialog if Racer failures occur" as it's no longer necessary.
   * Content Assist will now distinguish between setup errors (errors that the user can fix, which are related to configuration and not the source) and other tool errors. For setup errors, a dialog will always be shown. For the other errors, if Content Assist was invoked manually, a dialog will also be shown, but if it was activated automatically the error will only be displayed in the editor status line. 
 * Fixed: Eclipse variables not being substituted in environment-variables settings of launch configurations.
 * Fixed: NPE when invoking Content Assist inside a comment, string or character.

### 0.6.1
 * Improved the default names for automatically created launch configuration.
 * Added error display notification for Outline operation failures.
 * Fixed: Progress dialog never showing up when "Ok" pressed in LANG_NAME project properties page.
 * Fixed: Eclipse variables not being substituted in environment-variable values.
 * Fixed regression: Cargo not able to find rustc. (#113)

### 0.6.0
 * Added customization of the build command for Build Targets: It's now possible to specify a command other than the default one (the Cargo tool). 
   * Note however that RustDT still expects the command output (the compiler error messages) to be in the same format as the default tool.
 * Added support for invoking a specific Build Target when a Rust editor is saved. This is called "auto-check", and is intended for build commands that only check for compilation errors, but don't produce artifacts. This has the potential to be faster than a regular build. 
   * Default is `rustc --lib -- -Zno-trans`.
   * The goal for the future is to enable invoking this command on-the-fly (as the user types), although for this to be useful in practice it will likely require the compiler to support incremental compilation (or be super fast otherwise).
   * Added [Building](documentation/UserGuide.md#building) section to documentation.
 * Added support for modifying the environment variables of a Build Target's build command. (#72)  
 * RustDT no longer needs to save the editor before invoking Racer.
 * New Cargo project can now initialize project using `cargo init`. (#106)
 * Added some new code snippets: `enum`, `at` and `aq`, `if`, `ifl`, `whl`, `fn`, `fnr`, `test`, `macro`. (#109)

--
 * Fixed "IllegalStateException: The service has been unregistered" on Mars.2 when Eclipse is closed.
 * Fixed: Running Targets from "crate#tests" failed in OS X due to ".dSYM" dir. (#96)
 * Fixed: Format tool (`rustfmt`) is invoked when an editor is saved automatically due to code completion. (#101)
 * Fixed: Pressing Tab key does not indent according to Editor indentation preferences. (#99)
 * Fixed: syntax highlighting for the character literal `'\"'`. 

### 0.5.1
 * Added support for source formatting using `rustfmt` (`Ctrl+Shift+F`).
   * Added `Format Crate (cargo fmt)` command to Project context menu.
   * Added "Format automatically on editor save." option.
 * Added signing to releases.
 * Fixed incorrect icon for errors and warnings in preference page status.
 * Fixed: can't save preference pages with empty fields.
 * Fixed: Preferences "Download..." button not working in Windows if HOME env-var not set (now uses `%UserProfile%` instead).
   * Also, "Download..." button now tries to download to the existing location in the preferences field, if it's a valid one.
 * Fixed: debugging won't find the Rust installation sources (the standard library), if the configured `src` path is any other than `$SDK_PATH/src`.
 

### 0.5.0
 * Added support for Outline, Quick-Outline, and on-the-fly parser errors, using the [Rainicorn](https://github.com/RustDT/Rainicorn) tool.
 * Added Download operation to the Racer preferences (uses `cargo install`), as well as the Rainicorn preferences.
 * Added "match", "matchb", "apl", and "main" code snippets.
 * Added: The title of a Rust editor for "mod.rs" files is now "[foo]", where foo is the name of the parent directory (this should be the same as the module name). The objective is obviously to disambiguate editors when you have several "mod.rs" files open.
 * Added: Dirty editors are now automatically saved if a build is invoked directly from a Build Target in the Project Explorer. (if the workspace "Save automatically before build" option is enabled).
 * Fixed workspace resource locking when a build is invoked directly from a Build Target in the Project Explorer.
 * Fixed regression: Console view always activates when a build is invoked.
 * Fixed bug with Content Assist snippets using the `${word_selection}` variable.

### 0.4.2
 * Fixed: In debug, value of some variables not displayed due to "N/A (child of pretty printed object)" error.

### 0.4.1
 * After building, Cargo.toml syntax errors are now also displayed in editor as annotations.
 * Pressing F2 in the editor now shows information popup for problem under cursor (same as the mouse-over hover).
 * Improvement to Enter auto-indent when text after cursor has a closing brace. (Fixes #76)
 * Minimum and recommended CDT version is now `8.8`.
 * Project builder is no longer invoked when the workspace "Build Automatically" setting is enabled and a file is saved. (this was considered a misfeature anyways)
 * When debugging, the source lookup path for the Rust standard library modules is now configured properly.
 * When debugging, fixed toggling breakpoints on and off for files that are outside the workspace.
 * When debugging, fixed opening source files that are are outside the workspace.
 * Fixed line breakpoint icon.
 * When debugging on Windows, the Rust GDB pretty printers are automatically configured, if they are found in `${RUST_ROOT}/bin/rustlib/etc/`.
   * Updated the documentation for [the above changes](documentation/UserGuide.md#gdb-pretty-printers).
 * Added Racer preference to enable/disable showing the error dialog if failures occur during Content Assist. (#74)

--
 * Fixed: Project Build Targets settings page shows wrong default for Program Path field.
 * Fixed: Editor syntax highlighting of raw strings.

 
### 0.4.0
 * Added support for Eclipse dark theme. Namely:

 * Added Content Assist support of name-only proposal insertion by pressing `Ctrl+Enter`. (only applicable to proposals that insert arguments)
 * Changed: newly created launch configurations now have the debug option "Stop on startup at:" set to false by default. This way debugging won't stop on the C `main`, which is essentially useless outside of C/C++.
 * Added: `cargo update` action to Project explorer context menu. (#17)

--
 * Fixed: Properly implemented editor highlighting of Rust attributes with strings in them. (#24)
 * Fixed: AssertionFailureException pressing Enter after source with more closing braces than opening ones.
 * Fixed: Unindent (Shift-Tab) broken, does nothing after empty lines in selection.
 * Fixed "Unknown line format: " when invoking autocompletion with racer. (#68)
 

### 0.3.0
 * Added support for Build Targets, based on Cargo build targets.
   * Available Build Targets are displayed in the Project Explorer.  You can configure which targets are enabled or not for a workspace build. Or run/debug a specific target.
   * Top-level Build Targets are: `crate#no-tests` and `crate#tests`. You can run/debug specific Cargo binaries or tests from the context menu of the Build Targets.
   * Added Project Build Configuration property page to configure Build Target options.
 * Added specific Project Explorer icons for Rust crate elements: the `src`, `test`, `target` folders; the `Cargo.toml` file.
 * Added Project Explorer element with Cargo dependency references.
 * Added: launch shortcut for a Rust project and Rust integration tests. This is a quick way to create a launch from the Project Explorer context-menu, by selecting either a project, or a Rust test source file in `tests/`, and selecting "Run As" or "Debug As".
 * Added new [Configuration](documentation/UserGuide.md#configuration) section in the User Guide. (#46)
 * Added UserGuide note about using Homebrew GDB in OS X.

Fixes:

 * Doc: added note about Cygwin GDB not being recommended for debugging. 

### 0.2.1
 * Added Content Assist preference page, with auto-activation options (#23).
 * Improved transparency/aliasing of content assist icons - this improves them for dark themes.
 * Upgraded minimum Java version to Java 8
  * Added: Show error message dialog if starting Eclipse with a Java version below the minimum.
 * Added: Content Assist proposal list now shows a popup on the right with a small description of the selected proposal.
  * However, this is based on information provided by Racer, which at the moment is fairly limited.

Fixes:
 * Fixed #31: Added workaround to fix OS X issue "Could not execute process `rustc -vV`". 
 * Fixed #27: the preference pages are now searchable in the Preferences dialog search field, by means of relevant keywords.
